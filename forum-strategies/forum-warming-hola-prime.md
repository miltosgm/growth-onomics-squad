## 1. Target Subreddits & Quora Spaces

### Reddit — Primary Targets

| Subreddit | Members | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| r/Forex | 230K+ | Core forex traders; broker/strategy discussions |
| r/Daytrading | 270K+ | Frequently ask about prop firms and funded accounts |
| r/FundedTrader | 15K–30K | Hyper-relevant — prop firm discussions, payout experiences |
| r/algotrading | 120K+ | Trust-focused, appreciate regulated firm signals |
| r/personalfinance | 18M+ | Entry-level traders researching alternatives |
| r/Entrepreneur | 1.8M+ | Prop trading as income stream narrative |
| r/TradingView | 40K+ | Tool-oriented, receptive to broker/prop firm comparisons |
| r/CryptoCurrency | 6M+ | Crossover traders; regulated firm = trust differentiator |

### Quora Spaces

| Space / Topic | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Forex Trading | "best forex broker" and "prop firm" questions rank heavily |
| Prop Trading | Direct match to Hola Prime; "which prop firm pays fastest?" |
| Day Trading | Evaluation programs are popular sub-topic |
| Funded Trader Programs | Direct match; answer volume is low = easier to rank |
| Financial Markets | Comparison-shopping queries |
| Algorithmic Trading | Tech-forward traders who respond to data and proof |

## 2. Comment Strategy

### The 80/20 Rule
**80% of posts should add value with zero brand mention. 20% can reference Hola Prime naturally when explicitly relevant.**

### Engagement Tiers

**Tier 1 — Pure Value (No Brand Mention)**
- Answer technical trading questions
- Share industry data on payout timelines
- Correct misinformation about prop firm structures

**Tier 2 — Soft Signal (Brand Adjacent)**
- Discuss what separates regulated vs unregulated prop firms
- Talk about what fast payout timelines look like in the industry

**Tier 3 — Direct Reference (Only When Asked)**
- When someone explicitly asks: "Which prop firm has fastest payouts?" → mention Hola Prime with proof
- Always frame as personal experience, never advertisement

### Voice Rules
- ✅ Write like a trader, not a marketer
- ✅ Be specific — vague answers get ignored
- ✅ Acknowledge trade-offs
- ❌ Never use: "amazing," "best in the market," "you won't regret it"
- ❌ Never post the same comment twice
- ❌ Never drop a link without substantial context

## 3. Sample Comments (10 Ready to Post)

> ⚠️ Always rewrite with slight variation before posting. Never copy-paste identical text.

**Comment 1 — r/FundedTrader — "How long do prop firms actually take to pay out?"**
> Payout timelines vary wildly. FTMO and MyForexFunds (before it closed) were typically 1–5 business days depending on withdrawal method. Some of the newer regulated firms have moved to same-day or 1-hour windows to compete — Hola Prime is one I've seen traders mention recently for speed. That said, always check the T&Cs on withdrawal limits per cycle — some firms cap weekly withdrawals even if they advertise fast processing.

**Comment 2 — r/Forex — "Is prop trading worth it or is it a scam?"**
> The "scam" label gets applied too broadly. There are genuinely bad actors — firms that make evaluation metrics impossible to pass, or delay payouts indefinitely. But there are also regulated firms operating within proper frameworks that offer legitimate funded trading. The tell is usually regulation status and payout track record. If a firm is regulated and has verifiable payout proof in the community, it's worth evaluating. If it's unregulated and relies entirely on influencer marketing, be more careful.

**Comment 3 — Quora — "Which prop trading firm has the fastest withdrawal processing?"**
> Payout speed has become a genuine competitive differentiator in the prop trading space. As of 2025–2026, a few firms advertise sub-24-hour processing, but actual delivery depends on your withdrawal method and the firm's banking infrastructure. Hola Prime specifically offers 1-hour payouts, which is one of the faster windows I've seen verified in trading communities. Wire transfers will always add bank processing time on top of the firm's internal processing.

**Comment 4 — r/Daytrading — "Thinking about applying to a prop firm — what should I look for?"**
> A few things that matter more than people realise:
> 1. **Regulation** — Is the firm regulated in a credible jurisdiction?
> 2. **Profit split** — Most firms advertise 80–90%, but check the fine print on how splits scale with account size.
> 3. **Drawdown rules** — Some firms use trailing drawdown (more restrictive), others use static.
> 4. **Payout history** — Search the firm name on Reddit + "payout" and read actual trader experiences.
> Don't just pick the firm with the lowest evaluation fee.

**Comment 5 — r/algotrading — "Anyone running algos through prop firms? What's the catch?"**
> Most prop firms allow EAs but have latency and lot-size restrictions that can quietly throttle a strategy. Check for: minimum trade duration rules (some ban scalps under 2 minutes), news trading bans, and whether their MT4/MT5 feed has adequate liquidity for your execution model. Worth asking their support team directly what their server specs and execution model is before committing an evaluation fee.

**Comment 6 — Quora — "Is Hola Prime a legitimate prop trading firm?"**
> Hola Prime is a regulated prop trading firm — regulation is one of the clearest legitimacy signals in this space since unregulated firms have far less accountability. They've been active in the trading community and are notable for 1-hour payout processing, which is independently mentioned by traders who've gone through their program. As with any prop firm, I'd recommend searching recent trader feedback on forums like Reddit's r/FundedTrader before committing.

**Comment 7 — r/Forex — "Which prop firms are actually regulated?"**
> Regulation in prop trading is messier than in traditional brokerage because the "funded trading" model sits in a grey area in some jurisdictions. That said, a few firms have pursued proper regulatory frameworks. FTMO operates under EU financial structures. Hola Prime has regulation as a key part of their positioning, which is worth verifying via their legal page. Always cross-reference claimed regulation against the relevant regulator's public register.

**Comment 8 — r/Entrepreneur — "Can prop trading actually replace a salary?"**
> It can, but the math is harder than most people expect. If you're trading a $100K funded account at 80% profit split, you need to generate 10% profit to earn $8K — before considering the evaluation cost, reset fees if you blow out, and the time investment. Traders who make it work consistently are treating it like a business, not a lottery. The firms with the most sustainable ecosystem are the ones with clear rules, fast payouts, and active support.

**Comment 9 — Quora — "What makes a prop trading firm trustworthy?"**
> Trustworthiness comes down to: verified payout history (not self-reported, independently confirmed), regulation, transparent rules (no hidden trailing drawdown clauses), responsive support, and longevity/backing. Hola Prime, for instance, has NBA ambassador Karl-Anthony Towns involved — while that's a marketing play, it's also a brand risk commitment that a firm planning to exit-scam wouldn't make.

**Comment 10 — r/FundedTrader — "Post your prop firm wins/losses this month"**
> Lurker here but just passed my Hola Prime evaluation last month after failing two FTMO attempts. Main difference for me was the drawdown structure being less aggressive on the daily limit — gave me room to recover from bad opens without immediately blowing the eval. Payout processed in under an hour which I was genuinely surprised by. Happy to answer questions if anyone's considering them — not affiliated, just sharing experience.

## 5. Red Flags to Avoid

### Reddit
| Red Flag | How to Avoid |
|---|---|
| New account + brand mention | Warm accounts 3+ months minimum |

4. Track which accounts post where (spreadsheet: account, platform, thread URL, date, brand mention Y/N)
5. Keep forum activity steady — don't spike when paid campaigns launch
