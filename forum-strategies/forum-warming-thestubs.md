## 2. Comment Strategy

### Core Principle
**Answer the question. Be the helpful person in the room. Drop the tool only when it's the natural next step.**

### The 3-Layer Approach
- **Layer 1 — Pure Value (80%):** Full answer, no link, no tool mention
- **Layer 2 — Soft Mention (15%):** Answer, then: "There are free online tools for this"
- **Layer 3 — Direct Mention (5%):** Only when someone explicitly asks for a recommendation

### Target Thread Types
1. "How do I prove income as a freelancer/contractor?"
2. "My landlord is asking for pay stubs — what do I do?"
3. "Do gig workers get pay stubs?"
4. "What should a pay stub include?"
5. "I'm self-employed and need a pay stub for a loan"
6. "What's the easiest way to make a pay stub?"
7. "How do I pay myself as a small business owner?"
8. "Do I need to give my part-time employee pay stubs?"

## 3. Sample Comments (10 Ready to Post)

> ⚠️ Always rewrite with slight variation. Never copy-paste identical text.

**Comment 1 — r/freelance — "How do I prove income when I'm self-employed?"**
> Totally normal situation. Most landlords and lenders just want to see consistent income, not a traditional pay stub specifically. What works: 3 months of bank statements showing deposits, your invoices, and a letter from your accountant if you have one. If they specifically need a pay stub format, there are free online generators where you enter your earnings info and it produces a proper document — that works for most standard requests. Just make sure the numbers match your actual income.

**Comment 2 — r/uberdrivers — "Can I use Uber earnings as proof of income for an apartment?"**
> Yes, you can — it just takes a bit more legwork than a W-2 employee. Uber's app lets you download an earnings summary from the tax section. Some landlords accept that. Others want something that looks more like a formal pay stub. In that case, a lot of gig workers use a free pay stub generator — you put in your weekly/monthly average earnings and it spits out a standard document. Just be accurate with your numbers and keep your Uber statements as backup.

**Comment 3 — r/personalfinance — "What exactly is on a pay stub?"**
> Good question — here's the breakdown:
> - **Gross pay** — what you earned before anything is taken out
> - **Federal & state income tax** — withheld based on your W-4
> - **FICA** — Social Security (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%)
> - **Net pay** — what actually hits your bank account
> If you're an employee, your employer handles all this. If you're self-employed, you handle it yourself — which is why many freelancers generate their own stubs to track this.

**Comment 4 — r/smallbusiness — "Do I need to give my part-time employee pay stubs?"**
> Short answer: it depends on your state, but most require it. California, New York, Texas — most major states require employers to provide itemized wage statements each pay period. The stub needs to show gross wages, all deductions, net pay, pay period dates, and your business info. If you only have one or two employees, you don't need payroll software — there are free tools online where you enter the details and print a clean stub.

**Comment 5 — r/legaladvice — "Landlord is demanding pay stubs but I'm a 1099 contractor"**
> 1099 contractors don't get traditional pay stubs from clients — that's completely normal. What you can offer instead: last 2–3 months of bank statements (highlight deposits), your 1099 forms from last year, or a self-generated pay stub showing your monthly income. Many contractors create their own stubs using free online generators — totally legitimate as long as the numbers are accurate. Combine with bank statements and most landlords are satisfied.

**Comment 6 — Quora — "What is the easiest way to make a pay stub for a small business?"**
> For small businesses with just a few employees or contractors, you really don't need full payroll software unless you want direct deposit and auto-tax filing. The simplest path: use a free online pay stub generator. You enter the employee's name, your business name, pay period, gross wages, and the tool calculates deductions and formats everything properly. Takes about 2 minutes per employee. I've used ThePayStubs for this — free, no account needed, clean output. Does the job.

**Comment 7 — r/doordash_drivers — "How do I get proof of income for a car loan?"**
> A few options that work: DoorDash earnings statements from your app, 3 months of bank statements showing regular deposits, your tax return/Schedule C, or a self-generated pay stub if the lender specifically needs that format. Most auto lenders are used to dealing with gig workers. Call them first and ask what they accept — saves you prep time.

**Comment 8 — r/humanresources — "What's the minimum info required on a pay stub?"**
> Federal law (FLSA) doesn't actually mandate pay stubs — but most states do. Generally, a compliant pay stub needs: employee name, employer name and address, pay period (start and end date), gross wages, all deductions itemized (federal tax, state tax, FICA, benefits), and net pay. California especially has strict rules — check your state's labor department site for exact requirements.

**Comment 9 — r/tax — "Do freelancers need to keep pay stub records?"**
> As a freelancer, you won't have traditional pay stubs from clients — but you absolutely need to keep income records: all invoices, payment confirmations/bank statements, 1099 forms from clients who paid you $600+, and your own income tracking spreadsheet. Some freelancers generate monthly "pay stubs" for themselves just to stay organized — especially useful when you need income verification for loans or housing.

**Comment 10 — Quora — "Can self-employed people create their own pay stubs?"**
> Yes, absolutely — and it's more common than people think. When you're self-employed, no employer is generating pay stubs for you. But there are legitimate reasons you'd need one: apartment applications, loan approvals, health insurance enrollment, or bookkeeping. You can generate your own using a free online pay stub tool. ThePayStubs is a good free option — no sign-up, takes 2 minutes. **Important note:** numbers need to be accurate and consistent with your bank statements and tax returns. Don't inflate income on documents you're submitting to lenders — that's fraud. For legitimate self-documentation? Totally fine.

## 5. Helpful vs. Spammy

### Helpful ✅
- Answer the full question before mentioning anything
- Mention the tool only when directly relevant
- Give context: "I've used this" not "Check out this amazing tool"
- Acknowledge other solutions
- Admit limitations: "If you need complex payroll, use actual software"

### Spammy ❌
- Leading with the link
- Posting the same comment in multiple subreddits
- Only commenting on pay stub threads
- Ignoring follow-up questions
- Using exact same phrasing repeatedly
- New account with no history pushing a product

### Positioning Framework
**Frame the tool as:** "A quick way to get a clean document when you just need the basics done"  
**Not as:** "The best pay stub generator online" or "a professional payroll solution"
